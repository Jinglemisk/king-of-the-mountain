Push-your-luck, lightweight adventure race for 2â€“6 players. Roll d4 to advance along a branching track. Land on Treasure, Chance, Sanctuary, Enemy, or Empty tiles. Fight enemies, duel other players, use items, and reach the final tile first. Shortcuts exist but are riskier (higher-tier enemies and better rewards).
